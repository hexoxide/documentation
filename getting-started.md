# Getting started

This project is continuously evolving and based on a lot of previous work. Before continuing this project it is deemed important to read the listed works to get a fundamental understanding of what is desired and what was already tried and determined before. Some of these works are not available online and it is important to ask project supervisors for these resources quickly. If for any reasons the supervisors fail to be able to supply the desired documents in a feasible amount of time your team is allowed to contact [Dantali0n](https://dantalion.nl/contact/). Please note that the previous works that are not readily available online should not be put online and that the one's supplied these documents take full responsibility for handling them correctly.

* [Alice Technical Design Report (TDR) - Upgrade off the Offline Online computing system](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2011297/files/ALICE-TDR-019.pdf)
* Load Balancing High Volume Network Traffic at ALICE After the Second Long Shutdown of CERNâ€™s LHC
* Effect of ticktime on the Re-initialization and Blacklist load balancing algorithms during a fail-over for ALICE
* [Effects of the EPNs and FLPs on the Information Node for ALICE](https://github.com/hexoxide/Thesis)
* [Team Hexoxide Technical Design Report](https://github.com/hexoxide/documentation/tree/master/technical-design-report)

These documents were listed in chronological order and are best read in that order. Next to these documents are the following online resources which might be of significant interest.

* [Team Hexoxide CodeCoverage](https://codecov.io/gh/hexoxide)
* [Alice O2 C++ coding guidelines](https://rawgit.com/AliceO2Group/CodingGuidelines/master/coding_guidelines.html)
* [Original O2Balancer](https://github.com/valvy/BalancerScripts)

## Using the team Hexoxide software

The O2Balancer software has been completely rewritten by team Hexoxide but still relies on almost the same dependencies as previous works. The software is specifically aimed at being compatible with ARM based processors and was tested on Raspberry Pi models 3+. As referenced by the TDR the list of dependencies and how to install them can be found in the repository: [Raspberry-Dependency](https://github.com/hexoxide/raspberry-dependency). The dependency scripts was tested on Debian based systems and the latest image of Raspbian is highly recommended as image to use.

## Recommended background information

The following background is recommended for being able to comprehend information found in documents and get started with the continuation of the project. Do not be alarmed if not all recommended background is immediately familiar.
